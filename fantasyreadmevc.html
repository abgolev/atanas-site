						<h2>Fantasy Cruncher Readme</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Fantasy Cruncher takes custom input and runs it on data from 1970-2019 imported directly from Fantasy Football Data Pros. Output is printed to the terminal as well as saved as a new .csv file in the working directory. Below are a screenshot of the GUI and explanations of the different customizable options:
