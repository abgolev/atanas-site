						<h2><b>Tutoring</b></h2>
					</header>
					<p>I tutored for 7 years and worked with college students as well as those in high, middle, and elementary school on all levels from gifted to remedial. Each student and each situation is unique, but once a student understands and becomes confident at the fundamentals of the subject, even the most complex ideas are within reach.</p>

								<p>Atanas is very knowledgeable. He is patient and calm while tutoring. He is professional and punctual. He connects with students. My daughters feel more confident in their understanding of math. I highly recommend.

								<p>Atanas has been absolutely fantastic in helping me get through my online statistics class. He has been easy to understand when we met in person and also on skype which we are doing now that we cannot meet in person. He is very patient with me even with having to explain problems repeatedly. I would highly recommend giving him a try!</p>

								<p>Atanas was a great fit for high school AP physics! He was punctual, knowledgable, patient, relatable to teenagers, and conveyed the material in an easily understood manner. I think my daughters may actually begin to enjoy the subject matter rather than considering it a chore.</p>

								<p>Helped me boost my GRE math score by 9 points! Atanas is a wonderful tutor! He is very patient and is very easy to work with. I needed his help with my GRE math score and he helped me boost my score by 9 points! Definitely recommend him.</p>
								<p>Devyn T. (GRE Math), Oct 2019</p>

								<p>My 14-year-old son learned a lot in the hour Atanas worked with him. Great first lesson. Our son is looking forward to feeling more confident in class and feels more in control of his grade now.</p>
								<p>Jennifer G. (Algebra I, Algebra II, Spanish, ACT), Feb 2018</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>My son had the pleasure of working with Atanas as his Algebra 2 tutor for the fall semester. Atanas is a fantastic tutor. His knowledge of the subject is outstanding, but more impressive is his ability to meet the student where he/she is and advance their mastery of the material. His ability to teach complex material is very good. Atanas also communicates well with parents and provides feedback after each session about the student's progress. I cannot say enough good things about working with Atanas. Atanas is flexible, knowledgeable and does everything in his power to rearrange is own schedule to work with the student before tests or quizzes. Overall, again, very, very impressive and a pleasant personality as well.</p>
								<p>Tricia M. (Algebra II), Jan 2018</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Great Tutor! I needed someone to work with me to prepare for the quantitative reasoning part of the GRE and Atanas was extremely helpful. He is very knowledgeable about math concepts and great at explaining things, especially when I needed something explained more than once or in a different way. He was also great at coming up with new problems when I had trouble grasping certain concepts. Highly recommend!</p>
								<p>Madelyn R. (GRE), Dec 2017</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>Wonderful tutor! My daughter is in her senior year and taking a dual credit course, Atanas has been invaluable in helping her succeed in the class. He is very patient and knowledgeable and encourages her to attempt to solve problems on her own, providing guidance when needed. We have seen significant improvements!</p>
								<p>Almeta D. (Calc I), May 2017</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>We tried many ACT Science tutors, Atanas is the best. My kids like his teaching style and the fact that he can explain the answers to them. We are so pleased with Atanas tutoring.</p>
								<p>Heba E. (ACT), Feb 2017</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>One of the best tutors we have ever had! I have four children and over the years, we have had numerous tutors in many subjects. Atanas has been one of the best we have ever had. He is extremely knowledgeable with Algebra (really all math) and chemistry. He is prompt and most importantly he relates to my son. My son attends the STEAM Academy and the curriculum in his Algebra 2 course was assigned at the beginning of the semester and the students must take responsibility for the majority of the learning. The teacher instructs but in a very non traditional manner. My son has received tutoring for most of the semester from Atanas. He was struggling to master concepts, thanks to Atanas, my son has gone from struggling to pass to completing the semester curriculum three weeks ahead of his class (with a high A). My son has spent the last three weeks helping his classmates learn the content and prepare for the EOC. Atanas has taken him from needing tutoring to being the tutor. If your student struggles academically it is a real self esteem killer. It's heartbreaking. Watching my son flourish under Atanas' tutelage and mentoring has been well worth the expense. Honestly, we have paid as much as $60 an hour for tutors and Atanas's fees are probably lower than they should be for what he provides. You will not regret choosing Atanas!</p>
								<p>-Stephanie H. (Algebra II, Precalc, Chemistry, Calc I), Dec 2016</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>I am studying for the GRE and needed help in the quantitative area since I've not taken math since high school. For the first session Atanas determined my strengths and weakness. From there he tailors lessons specifically to both what is important to the test and what I need to work on. He is very knowledgeable and more importantly, knows how to explain math in a way that helps the student remember and understand concepts easily.</p>
								<p>Sheila H. (GRE), June 2016</p>
                                                        </div>
							<div class="box">
								<p>My daughter has difficulties with math. Atanas was very patient with her, constantly giving her words of encouragement. By the end of his one hour lesson, he gave her one-sheet summary of the key points of the session. My daughter felt very comfortable with him and confident about herself.</p>
								<p>Keiko T. (Algebra II), Feb 2016</p>

							<div class="box">
								<p>Atanas is extremely patient and knowledgeable in all topics. He was able to know exactly what I needed to work on, provide study help, and aid in raising GRE scores.</p>
