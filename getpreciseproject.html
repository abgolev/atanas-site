						<h2>Using a Trust Game Framework to Evaluate Risk Aversion to Sharing Genomic Data</h2>
						<p>Bioinformatics research project for the Vanderbilt Summer Science Academy. The project used game theory principles to gauge how how participants weighed risk/reward in situations involving their genomic data versus their wealth.</p>
					</header>
					<p> There is an increasing tendency for patients to have their genomic data sequenced and processed in the clinical domain. While there is an opportunity to personalize an individual's care, such data disclosure also raised various privacy risks.
					<p> This project gauged the degree to which an individual will assume such risks in exchange for the potential benefit that may be realized by sharing genetic data for biomedical research purposes. The methodology built on a two-participant trust game framework, a behavioral economics technique. The project's purpose was to find if there would be a significant difference between participants' risk aversion to sharing their genetic data versus the risk aversion to suffering a monetary loss. The findings could provide insight into public policy recommendations on how to obtain, process, and secure personal genetic data.
